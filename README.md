# Java Password Manager

A simple desktop password manager built with Java Swing.  
This project demonstrates basic secure storage and retrieval of passwords using AES encryption, file I/O, and a graphical interface.

---

## Features

- **AES Encryption**: All password data is encrypted and stored in `passwords.dat`.
- **Easy-to-Use GUI**: Manage and search your passwords in a simple table.
- **Master Password**: Protects access to your password vault (default: `admin`).
- **Search Function**: Quickly filter your saved passwords.

## Security Note

- Passwords are encrypted with AES, but the master password is fixed for demonstration.
- **Do not use this project to store real or sensitive data.**
- Improvements for real-world use could include:
  - Secure storage and hashing of the master password
  - Stronger key derivation (PBKDF2, bcrypt)
  - Enhanced error handling
